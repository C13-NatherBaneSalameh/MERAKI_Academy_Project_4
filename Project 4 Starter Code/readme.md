## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

I recently developed an e-learning platform designed to enhance the online learning experience for both students and instructors. The platform allows students to browse and watch course lessons, comment on lessons, and delete their own comments. Additionally, students can manage a personalized list of favorite lessons by adding or removing them as needed. To streamline the learning process, a search feature enables students to quickly find specific lessons within a course.

For instructors, the platform provides robust tools to manage their courses effectively. Instructors can upload and add lessons, create new courses, and edit or delete lessons as necessary. They also have the ability to moderate and delete comments, ensuring a positive learning environment. Furthermore, instructors can delete entire courses when needed, offering flexibility in managing their educational content. This project emphasizes user-friendly functionality to meet the diverse needs of both learners and educators.
